    title: "I need training for specific safety concerns. Is this something Must Be Me can provide?",
    description: "Absolutely. We are experienced in adding bespoke elements to augment our Must Be Me training to fit the needs of specific cultures, communities and circumstances. Our previous projects have involved working closely alongside different communities, businesses and groups of vulnerable people to create classes covering elements of safety improvement that are specific to their requirements. However, Must Be Me courses are designed to teach civilian personal safety – they are not suitable for those seeking self-defence training in a professional capacity, for example military staff or war journalists... Get in touch through our Contact us page to see how we can help with your specific safety-education needs."
